Play wave files out of an Audio Amp Module connected to Slot1.
You will need to copy the files "ahoy.wav" and "bye.wav" over to the root of your Yukon's filesystem.

Press "A" to start the first WAV file, or stop if anything is already playing.
Press "B" to start the second WAV file, or stop if anything is already playing.
Press "Boot/User" to exit the program.
